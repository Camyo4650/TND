A game.

The premise of the game is to be able to choose a class to play as.

Classes:
Light
Heavy
Support
Command

There are several modes of warfare in the game.

Modes:
Ground Combat
- This mode involves classic gun combat. Light moves faster with smaller guns, heavy moves slower with 
Trench Combat
- This mode involves trench digging and artillery manning by support; machinery manning by Heavy; waves of charges by Light; and logistics from Command.
Melee Combat
- Theme can be medieval, with Light being swordsmen; Heavy being cavalrymen; Support being archers; and Command leading the brigade.

*THESE WILL COME LATER*
Aerial Combat
Naval Combat

Game Appearance:
The world will be low poly, with procedural-terrain generation and general regulations on positioning of entities. Players will simply look like wooden mannequins.
