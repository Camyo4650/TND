# Warmongers
A game.

The premise of the game is to be able to choose a class to play as. Players can then choose what mode of warfare they desire to play, ranging from dozens of styles. Scoring system will be based on flagpoints.

Classes:
- Light
- Heavy
- Support
- Command

There are several modes of warfare in the game.

Modes: <br />
Ground Combat
- This mode involves classic gun combat. Light moves faster with smaller guns, heavy moves slower with bigger guns, etc.

Trench Combat
- This mode involves trench digging and artillery manning by support; machinery manning by Heavy; waves of charges by Light; and logistics from Command.

Melee Combat
- Theme can be medieval, with Light being swordsmen; Heavy being cavalrymen; Support being archers; and Command leading the brigade.

*THESE WILL COME LATER*:  <br />
- Aerial Combat <br />
- Naval Combat <br />

Game Appearance:
The world will be low poly, with procedural-terrain generation and general regulations on positioning of entities. Players will simply look like wooden mannequins.
